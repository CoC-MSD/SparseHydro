"""sparsehydro.models.abstraction — rainfall-abstraction (tank) models.

Ported from the Parsimonious Functions ``tank_models.py``.  Each model tracks a
storage "tank" whose fill state modulates a state-dependent effective-area
multiplier applied to rainfall, producing an *effective rainfall* series that
can be convolved with a unit hydrograph.

Models
------
- :class:`ConstantDrainTank` — ``V_C``: constant drainage per step.
- :class:`LinearDrainTank` — ``V_lin``: drainage proportional to storage (``k·V``).
- :class:`SqrtDrainTank` — ``V_sroot``: drainage proportional to ``k·sqrt(V)``.

All three expose the :class:`~sparsehydro.models.IModel` lifecycle and emit a
``p_excess_in`` / ``p_excess_mm`` column, matching
:class:`~sparsehydro.models.rdii.IAModel` so they are interchangeable as the
abstraction stage of :class:`~sparsehydro.models.AbstractionUHModel`.
